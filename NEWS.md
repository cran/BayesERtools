# BayesERtools 0.2.5

## Major changes

* Updated compatibility with upcoming changes to `loo_compare()` output
  structure in the `loo` package (> 2.9.0), which now returns a data frame
  instead of a matrix and includes additional diagnostic columns.

## Minor changes

* Allow manual breaks in `plot_er()` to control the position of the probability
  summary breaks for binary models
* Added `return_components` option to `plot_er()` and `plot_er_gof()` that 
  returns individual plot components (main plot, boxplot, caption) for 
  customization before recombining with `combine_er_components()`

# BayesERtools 0.2.4

## Major changes

* Extended covariate effects functionality to support linear regression models 
  (`ermod_lin`) in addition to binary logistic regression models (`ermod_bin`)
